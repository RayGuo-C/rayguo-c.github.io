Goal: 
    1. To explane various consitutive curve that is similar with relevant experimental result from the view of macro scale. Besides, know how to solve the results and relevant representative materials?
    2. descirbe the deformation from micro scale and meso scale in the material internal.
Questions:
    1. big deformation, and big strain
    2. big deformation, and small strain
    3. samll deformation, and small strain
    4. nonlinear deformation and linear material
    5. nonlinear deformation and nonlinear material
    6. linear deformation and linear material
    7. linear deformation and nonlinear material
